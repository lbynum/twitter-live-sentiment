# Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling with Spark Integration

Our project aims to perform high-level sentiment and topic analysis on Twitter data. 
If successful, our work will allow us to gain insights about what topics are trending, 
and how Twitter users feel about them. Tweets are an important and widely used form of 
communication, not only providing a source of entertainment but also useful news 
updates. We hope to gain an understanding of what topics are prevalent in tweets (and 
how this changes over time). Tweets are an interesting source of data by nature, 
constrained by the 140 character restriction but still able to leverage the variability 
of human language. Traditional methods for sentiment analysis and topic modelling may 
not perform as well on Tweets because they do not capture as much information as a 
full-length document. This project is interesting as a Big Data project because of the 
large number of daily new tweets (and other types of social media posts, were this work 
extended). A model, once trained, could be used to classify live social media data and 
understand and measure trends as they occur. Anyone interested in understanding such 
trends would use these types of results.
